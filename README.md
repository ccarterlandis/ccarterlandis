# 🌊 Heya! I'm Carter 🚀 🐠

Hello there! My name is Carter Landis, I'm a Data Engineer with a passion for crafting robust data pipelines and a penchant for using my skills to empower teams to use the data I can provide them in even better ways. 

I have experience with many data engineering tools as well as owning and maintaining the infrastructure needed to operate them, including Apache Airflow, Kubernetes, Terraform, and Kafka. I am dedicated to always providing my best work, learning everything shown to me, and identifying ways to improve any process I think needs it, even (especially) if it is difficult. Let's connect!
